/// StolenItemBehaviour.cs  
/// This script manages the behavior of items that can be stolen by the player.  
/// When the player interacts with the stolen item, it marks the player as having stolen the item,  
/// plays a pickup sound (if available), and removes the item from the scene.  
/// This mechanic ties into the game's objectives or consequences system, as stealing may trigger  
/// AI responses, objectives updates, or game progression changes.
