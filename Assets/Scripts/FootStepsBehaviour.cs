/// It tracks the total number of footprints the player has cleaned, as well as the total spawned in the scene.  
/// When the player cleans a footprint, the script increments the cleaned counter, logs relevant debug messages,  
/// and removes the footprint from the scene. This is tied to the gameâ€™s objective system,  
/// particularly for objectives requiring the cleanup of muddy footprints.
